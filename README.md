# Exercises collection
A collection of exercises done at university during computational physics lectures. It includes exercises about:
- Error analysis;
- Linear Algebra;
- Interpolation;
- Root finding problems;
- Numerical integration;
- Ordinary differntial equation.
<p>
Furthermore you will find a library with different modules dedicated to each section lisetd above and a report (coming soon) of all the results obtained where you will find the text of the exercises and a brief summary of the theory behind.

## Three body problem
This is divided into three different codes: [one](exercises/three_body_problem/3_body_problem.jl) that approximate the solution of the three body problem using RKDP (Dormand Prince method), [one](exercises/three_body_problem/check_3_body_problem.jl) that checks for the energy conservation and [one](exercises/three_body_problem/3_body_problem_animation.jl) that creates an animation.
