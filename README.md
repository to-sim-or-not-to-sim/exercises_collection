# Exercises collection
A collection of exercises done at university during computational physics lectures. It includes exercises about:
- Error analysis
- Linear Algebra
- Interpolation 
- Root finding problems
- Numerical integration
- Ordinary differntial equation
Furthermore you will find a library with different modules dedicated to each section lisetd above and a report of all the results obtain where you will find the text of the exercises and a brief summary of the theory behind.
