# Exercises collection
A collection of exercises done at university during computational physics lectures. It includes exercises about:
- [Error analysis](exercises/Error_analysis.jl)
- [Linear Algebra](exercises/Linear_systems.jl)
- [Interpolation](exercises/Interpolation.jl)
- [Root finding problems](exercises/Root_finding.jl)
- [Numerical integration](exercises/Integration.jl)
- [Ordinary differential equation (ODEs)](exercises/ODE.jl)
  
Additionally, you will find:
- a [library](MyLib.jl) with different modules dedicated to each section;
- a report (coming soon), summarizing all the results obtained, where you will find the text of the exercises and a brief summary of the theory behind.

## Schrödinger equation
There are also [a few exercises](exercises/Schrodinger.jl) covering both time-independent and time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

## Three body problem
This is divided into three different scripts: 
- [one](exercises/three_body_problem/3_body_problem.jl) that approximates the solution of the three body problem using RKDP (Dormand Prince method);
- [one](exercises/three_body_problem/check_3_body_problem.jl) that checks for the energy conservation;
- [one](exercises/three_body_problem/3_body_problem_animation.jl) that creates an animation.

## My purpose
This repository collects all the exercises I've wrote during computational physics lectures and I think that may help others studying numerical methods for mathematical and physical problems.

Note: this repository is unlikely to be updated.
